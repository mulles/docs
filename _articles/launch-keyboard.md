### Flashing Custom QMK firmware

You can read about creating custom QMK firmware [here](https://github.com/system76/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/system76/launch_1). In order to flash the firmware the keyboard will need to be in Programmable Mode and to do this hold the <kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>ESC</kbd> keys before connecting the keyboard to your system. If it is in Programmable Mode you will not see any lights on the keyboard.
